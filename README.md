# sorting-visualizar-in-javascript
A project done to improve my data structures skills and dynamic programming. HTML,CSS and Javascript technologies where used to build this app.
In this Project i showed a visualization of sorting algorithms. In which multiple sorting algorithms are used.
Types of sorting using:
bubble sort,
insertion sort,
shell sort,
quick sort,
merge sort,
these are the sorting algorithms used to implement my visualizer.
